// let score= 34;
// console.log(typeof(score));
// // or
// console.log (typeof score); //in this type it defines about the type and gives response which is "number"

// let valueinNumber= Number(score);
// console.log(valueinNumber)
// console.log(typeof (valueinNumber)); // it will give us the type of the value given in this case it was numeric so it gave number; if it would have been in double quotes ("") it would have given string and so on some examples are given below//


// let score = "34gkdmf";
 
// console.log (typeof score);
// console.log (typeof(score)); // these can be used simultaneously for knowing the type of the variable given

// let valueinNumber = Number (score);
// console.log(valueinNumber);// it will show NaN ("not a number" )as its also a types and it shows this because js isn't scrictly checked.


//  if it would have been null
// let score = null;
 
// console.log (typeof score);
// console.log (typeof(score)); // these can be used simultaneously for knowing the type of the variable given iska typeof object hi aayega

// let valueinNumber = Number (score);
// console.log(valueinNumber); // it would be given 0 which isn't completely correct ut not completely wrong


// if it would have been for undefined
// let score = undefined;
 
// console.log (typeof score);
// console.log (typeof(score)); // these can be used simultaneously for knowing the type of the variable given

// let valueinNumber = Number (score);
// console.log(valueinNumber); // it will also give NaN rather than giving undefined


// if it would have been for boolean
// let score = true;
 
// console.log (typeof score);
// console.log (typeof(score)); // these can be used simultaneously for knowing the type of the variable given

// let valueinNumber = Number (score);
// console.log(valueinNumber); // it will give 1 if true and 0 if false

// let score = "amrit";
// console.log(score); // o/p == amrit
// console.log(typeof score); o/p == string
// console.log(typeof(score));o/p == string
// let valueinNumber = Number(score);
// console.log(valueinNumber); // it'll give NaN coz the string isn't a number in rest below console.log it'll give nuber because its taking number from the function and its not strictly checked.
// console.log(typeof valueinNumber); o/p == number
// console.log(typeof(valueinNumber));o/p == number

// let isLoggedIn= "";
// console.log (isLoggedIn);// its an empty string and it prints an empty space coz the string which was given was empty; so it does print things but its not visible as it was an empty string

// let BooleanisLoggedIn = Boolean(isLoggedIn)
// console.log(typeof BooleanisLoggedIn);// o/p == it gives boolean as type
// console.log(BooleanisLoggedIn); // this goives false as we gave it an empty string; if we would have given anything in that string it would have given true as response//
 

// SUMMARY
//33 == we get number as type in return 
// "33" == we get sting as atype in return
// "33anjnf" == we get string as a type in return but after console.log the main value we get NaN as the type
// {for boolean ; true== 1 ; false == 0;
// "" == false ; "we" == true} \\
// these are basic conversions which are used in js\\


// let someRandomNumber=33;
//  console.log (someRandomNumber); // o\p == 33

//  let StringinNumber = String (someRandomNumber); // the string fn before (someRandomNumber) is called constructor or conversion function.
//  console.log (typeof StringinNumber); // o\p == string (as the string is the coversion function even tho the input no. is a numeric value )
